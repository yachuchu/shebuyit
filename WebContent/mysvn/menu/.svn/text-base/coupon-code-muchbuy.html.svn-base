	<div class="" style="margin-bottom:20px">
	
		<p>From time to time we issue coupon codes and promotional certificates that can be redeemed during the checkout process. If you are having trouble redeeming a coupon code try one of the tips below:</p>

<p><strong>Where do I enter my coupon code?</strong></p>
<p>Coupon codes are entered on the shopping cart page. After you have added items to your cart look for the box titled "Coupon code?" directly below the list of items in your cart. Enter your code and click the "go" button. Your discount is shown in red. This discount is updated in real-time as you add or remove items from your cart. If you add or remove items that void your discount it may look like the coupon code is not working. Try adding item(s) that are eligible for your specific coupon code.</p>

<p>Once you've added an item to your cart, click <strong><em>Apply shop coupon code</em></strong>&nbsp;above "Item total" to enter the coupon code for your order.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then enter the coupon code into the space provided and click the <em>Apply</em> button. &nbsp;The coupon discount will adjust your order total.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why is my coupon code not working?</strong></p>
<p>Some coupons may require a minimum purchase amount or may be valid for a limited time only. Please check the terms of use associated with your coupon code (consult the promotional e-mail, website, or other point of issue) making sure the items in your cart fulfill any requirements associated with the coupon code. If you are still having problems please <a href="http://www.shedressup.com/contact-us"><font color="red">e-mail us</font></a> for assistance.</p>
